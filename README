There are many questions about Yale students I've always wondered about. For example, does how far students have to walk to get up Science Hill affect their decision to become science majors? In order to study this, and other questions, I scraped together a dataset of students and their college, year, and major.

I plan to do some exploratory analysis of this data, as well as use it to practice data analysis and visualizations.

If you have any ideas for interesting ideas the data can be used for by all means let me know.
